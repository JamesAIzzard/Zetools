- Sorter cooler module part number: 61381-1086

## Notes
- :20201214164918: This is done.
- :20201214151524: OK, sorter cooler block is done now. Time to build it into the whole thermal assembly.
- :20201214145159: Build the cooler assembly up first, and start organising the holes by moving the tubes around once all the parts are correct.
- :20201214115949: Just saved one of the existing thermal modules off as a copy with the new part number for the sorter version.
- Next steps will be to work through and create all of the sorter module specific subassemblies and parts, and insert them into this new sorter top level cooler assy.
