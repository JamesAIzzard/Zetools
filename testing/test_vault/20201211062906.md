# Zettelkasten - Tagging Guidelines

## Tag Formatting
Tags are placed immediately after the page title, collected together in square brackets, as shown below:

The square brackets ensure the tag cannot be mistaken for a heading.

## Why Tag Things?
Tags identify the *type* of note while titles relate to the subject. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule. The first exception is project names. Adding project names makes it very easy to find content related to a particular project[^1]. The second exception is the `#todo` tag, used to indicate how notes can be extended.

### Negation When Searching
As the database grows, it must not become harder to find information. Otherwise, we have a situation where adding information makes the network *less* valuable. Tags help here. Not only can you search *for* tags, but also *exclude* tags. For example, you may be searching for `classes`, but you know you are not interested in `#task` or `#journal`. Being able to negate these notes is likley to significantly reduce and improve the search results.

## Type Tags
- `#file`: The note is a wrapper, providing information around some other file.
- `#journal`: The note is a journal entry.
- `#backlog`: The note is a backlog list.
- `#main`: The note is the primary page for a topic or project. There can only be **one** `#main` tag per project.
- `#meeting`: The note is a record of a meeting.
- `#review`: The note reviews a book, research paper, etc.
- `#template`: The note is a template or example of a specific type of solution.

## Task Tags
`#task` indicates the note is a completable task, often associated with a project. Task tags must be combined with either of the following completeness tags:
- `#incomplete`: The note is an incomplete task.
- `#complete`: The note is a completed task.

## Project Name Tags
All project related notes should be tagged directly with the project name. This makes searching for project content much easier.

## The `#Todo` Tag
`#todo` Is an odd one out, and does not apply at the note level. It is used to identify further work which should be done **to improve the note**. It should not be used for listing external tasks. This is what `#task` is for.
