# Python - Use Static Method to Initialise Static Variable

I was hoping to be able to pass a class' method when initialising a static variable, like this:
```py
class C:
    def __init__(self, foo:Callable):
        self._foo = foo

class D:

    bar:'C' = C(D.ping) # Unresolved reference 'D'
	
	# I also tried this;
	# bar:'C' = C(ping) # Unresolved reference 'ping'

    def __init__(self):
        ...

    def ping(self, pong:str):
        ...
```

However, I got the unresolved reference issues above. 

I posted the question to StackExchange here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65318707/python-3-9-passing-method-when-initialising-static-variable

One answer pointed out that this works if I declare the static attributes *after* the methods have been declared in the class, like this:

```py
class D:
    print(locals())
    def __init__(self):
        ...

    def ping(self, pong:str):
        ...

    bar:'C' = C(ping)
    print(locals())

d = D()
```

Printing `locals()` as above produces the following output:
```py
{'__module__': '__main__', '__qualname__': 'D', '__annotations__': {}}
{'__module__': '__main__', '__qualname__': 'D', '__annotations__': {'bar': 'C'}, '__init__': <function D.__init__ at 0x0000021AEA7EA820>, 'ping': <function D.ping at 0x0000021AEA7F08B0>, 'bar': <__main__.C object at 0x0000021AEA7A5FD0>}
```

This illustrates how the method is not part of the class' dictionary before declaration, but *is* after declaration.
