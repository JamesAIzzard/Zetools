# Design Review with HiFi

- Ben Metcalf
- Benjamin Lassus
- Annabelle Gerard

## Agenda/Purpose
- Settle disputes over design changes.
	- Moving the cooler on the sorter station closer to the waste bottle.
	- Lowering the HFE bottles into the deck.

## Outcomes
- We agreed to lower the tube holders by 90mm. This will be fairly painful, and will require a slight tweak to the chassis to get the din rail sitting lower, but its effectively essential for them.
  Incidentally, the issue for them was when they were disconnecting the hoses, the head pressure on the raised pipes was forcing the HFE oil out onto the deck. This root cause only came clear in this meeting. It helped a lot to understand why they wanted the change.
- We agreed to rotate the sorter cooler by 90 degrees, and bring the outlets as close to the waste bottle as possible:

  We'll have to be careful not to bring it into the space occupied by the Basler camera cable from the sorter station.
