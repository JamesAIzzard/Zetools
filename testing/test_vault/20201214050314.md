# Add Support Plate and Finalise Laser Chassis Assembly
#task #complete #rokkaku 

## Detail
Ben Metcalf pointed out that the laser box needs to have a rigid member between its feet, and the four independent anti-vibration feet. This is to prevent shear across the laser box, which contains sensitive components.

## Info
- [Thorlabs PWA074 Anti Vibration Feet](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=PWA074)
- M10 holes in top of anti vibration feet.
- .OD 7mm holes in bottom plate of anti vibration feet on 60mm square.

## Notes
- :20201216164728: Done!
- :20201216151045: Just because we have 8mm slots doesn't mean we need to use t-nuts with 8mm threads. This would be silly on this instrument.
- :20201215133615: Next steps here are to finish adding the fixing holes in the two mounting plates, and add the fixings.
- :20201215120103: Really good progress with this now. Chassis is in, and I have come up with a way of getting it to sit low enough to preserve access to the lid, and also to access the air nozzles. Another side effect of lowering it out of the bottom of the instrument, is that the laser cable output no longer clashes with the fan on the thermal assembly.
- :20201215103405: Plate is in. Need to watch out for the feet mounting screws against the item rail though.
