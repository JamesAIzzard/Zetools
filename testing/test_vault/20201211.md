Wow, big day today. Lots done though. The difficult situation with HiFi seems to be easing up a little. Had a couple of meetings with them. There is still a huge amount of work to do, but we have a better understanding of what they want.
I also managed to get my run in, in the afternoon, and it turned out to be a pretty fast one.
About to head home now. Lot's to pick up tomorrow, but remember, keep making steady progress forwards, however harsh the pressure feels.
