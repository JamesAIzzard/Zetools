Cleaned the fish out.

Made pretty good progress with [[20201212100321]] so far this morning. The application is now running, and printing screens to the console. There are some issues with the navigation bar, it doesn't seem to be responding, and there is some hacky code creating a modified cut-and-shut version of the navigation bar for the dash component, inside the menu component. Overall though, happy. Going to have a break now and clean the fish, then move onto sorting out work emails after a shower and a coffee. :)

Woke up suprisingly early, with no alarm or light. I could do with getting onto some design work today for Rokkaku, so I'm going to push ahead with my code project now, rather than try and force myself to go back to sleep. Starting with [[20201212100321]].
