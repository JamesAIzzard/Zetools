# Chess - Protected by Check

When you are not making a capture because it looks like a trade in which you would loose, always double check to make sure your opponent can actually make that move.

Consider this scenario:

Here, I was initially unsure if I should move kxe5, capturing the pawn which was there. I was assuming black would move kxe5 also. However, they can't. This would open up check on black's king from the bishop.

Often not noticing similar situations can lead to missed checkmates. I have failed to take pieces directly in front of the king, assuming the king would take back immediately, but actually can't because another peice would place the king in check if he made this capture.

Always double check for this situation before deciding not to make a move.
