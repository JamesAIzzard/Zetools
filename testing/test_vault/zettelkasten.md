## Welcome!
Effectively, the zettelkasten is my second brain. Everything worth noting down goes in here. It is a living record of my work, knowledge and thoughts. One day, it will be *enourmous*. Therefore, to keep things managable, we have to follow a few rules. These are presented in the following sections.

## Index

## Guidelines
Guidelines can be found [here](20201219065246)

## Searching
Searching plaintext notes turned out to be suprisingly difficult. I am in the process of [creating my own search tooling](20201219071312). Use the link above to access the Zettel searcher.
