# PyConsoleApp - Argless Responders

## They Do Not Have *Markerless Args*!
They are responders without arguments, therefore they do not have *markerless* args; they have *no* args. I just found myself wondering why an argless responder was not showing as *being markerless*, since there are no markers, but there are actually no args at all.
