## Agenda/Objectives
Review the first draft of the hinged cover concept.

## Outcomes
- Move knuckle more towards the centre of the door. This will have the effect of bringing the handle to a similar height as the hinge in its open position.
- Try and extend the wing on the lower section of the hinging door, so that the side wall doesn't have to reach as far forwards.
- Swap the single central handle on the front access panel for two handles 1/3 of the way along.
